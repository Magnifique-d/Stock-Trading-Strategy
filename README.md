On-Balance-Volume (OBV) Stock Trading Strategy Using Python

# OBV capitalizes on this idea by keeping a running tally of volume when price moves up or down. On up days, volume (e.g., share count) is added to the indicator. On down days, volume is subtracted from the indicator. OBV can be used in any kind of system â€“ trend following/momentum or price reversal.
